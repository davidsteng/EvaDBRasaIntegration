"The war in Ukraine has been on for 415 days. Who is winning it? Not Russia. Certainly not Ukraine. It is the US oil companies. US oil companies have reached $200 billion in pure profits. The earnings are still on. They are still milking this war and sharing the spoils. Let us look at how Exxon mobile has been doing. In 2022, the company made $56 billion in profits. Oil companies capitalized on instability and they are profiting from pain. American oil companies are masters of this art. You may remember the war in Iraq. The US went to war in Iraq by selling a lie. The Americans did not find any weapons of mass destruction but they did find lots of oil. And in the year since, American officials have admitted this. And this story is not over. It's repeating itself in Ukraine. They are feeding another war and filling the coffers of US oil companies."
